# Design Knowledge
A simple application which displays design quotes using fetch. 

## Intention
Use fetch to display a random quote from an array of quote objects. 

#### Timeframe
1/2 day

## Process
The quote objects which are used for this application were written and stored in a local JSON file (quotes_list.json). I only used basic styling for this project as I wanted to focus on my Git workflow and manipulating HTML elements and text content with Javascript. I made the most basic changes to this project on the master branch, but created a new branch to work on the more complicated Javascript and AJAX problems. 

## Challenges 
I accidentally committed some styling and HTML structure changes to one of my branches which I was specifically using to write my Javascript. This presented a good opportunity to figure out how to revert commits, which I haven't had to do until now. 

## Lessons learned
Although it wasn't strictly necessary to do so for this project, in the process of building this app I learned that I can't access APIs locally with Google Chrome. Since I plan to make a few more applications with fetch, I read and followed the set-up instructions on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) for setting up and running a local server. 

## Future develoment 
This application can be easily repurpoused to generate any random peice of data from another public API endpoint by changing the API endpoint in the fetch parenthesis.
